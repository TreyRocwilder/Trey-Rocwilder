Im not a lawyer, so I am positive that this will be riddled with typos spelling errors and mistakes. However I beleave I have Invented something larger than Infinity. If I attempt to correct every little detail I would never have the time to publish my research. Through my own personal experiences and specific skill sets I have amassed a group of skills that don't seem to be placed together successfully often. With this repository I will be doing my best do document my scientific experiences, resources, and code knowledge as best I can.
